										</header>
										<p>In 2021, Freedom House reported a significantly low scores in political rights and civil liberties for the Philippines.
										This came after the Duterte administration failed to secure peace treaties with the CPP-NPA and more, declared them as terrorists.
										Journalists, activities, and opposing political parties also became main targets of harassment and were labelled as communist sympathizers which resulted in increased risks of physical assault from state forces.
										The continuous deterioration of human rights in the country was further accelerated by the
										administration's draconian "War on Drugs", normalizing impunity especially in the smallest units of state forces.

									<h3>Null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>): There are no specific actors behind civilian casualty. That is, it occurs randomly.</h3>

									<h3>Alternative hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>): There are specific actors behind civilian casualty in the Philippines; fatal violence against civilians is intentional.</h3>

									<p>To address the hypotheses, two variables will be compared, inter1, which determines the type of actor, and is_fatal, which denotes whether an encounter resulted in a casualty. As both variables are categorical, they will be subjected to the Chi-Square Test of Independence to test the relationship between them.</p>

									<h3>The test results, whose computation is available on the Colab link below, show that a <u>p-value < 0.01 < 0.05</u> with <u>dof = 3</u>. Hence, the null hypothesis is <u>rejected</u>. That is, there are indeed specific actors that enact violence on civilians, causing their deaths.</h3>

								<h3>Imagine walking down a dark alley in the city and encountering a police officer…</h3>

								<h3>How safe do you think your life is during this encounter?</h3>
									
								<h3>Here’s our machine learning model, designed to predict whether your encounter is fatal or not based on some parameters.</h3>

								
								<button type="button" class="collapsible">Discussion</button>
								<div class="collapsible-content">
									<h3>Logistic Regression was used to predict whether a certain event was fatal or not based on some features of the dataset.</h3>

									
									<ul class="alt">
										<li>The model was able to provide around <u>93%</u> accuracy of response to unseen data based on its given features.</li>
										<li>Some of the features influencing the model's predictions are whether the parties involved were drug suspects, police forces, or civilians.</li>
										<li>This indicates that the fatality of a situation highly depends on the presence of these groups in an encounter.</li>
										<li>This is further solidified by the findings of our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where drug suspects are the largest targeted group and the police forces being the largest group among their offenders.</li>
										<li>Given the accuracy of these predictions, these features become crucial in understanding the dynamics of fatal encounters, shedding light on who the real victims and suspects are, and offering a clearer view of who Filipinos are really dying from.</li>

								<h2 style="color:#E50914">Conclusion</h2>
								<blockquote>State authorities, who are tasked with enforcing the law and protecting life are revealed as the primary perpetrators of civilian victimization and casualty in the Philippines. Additionally, the present state of Philippine society exposes the common Filipino to political violence more if they are a member of a particular group, such as government employees or suspected drug users.
								</blockquote>

								<h3  style="color:#E50914">What does this mean for us?</h3>
								<p>The moment has come for the Filipino people to hold those in authority responsible. As the credibility of justice institutions in the Philippines slowly corrodes, we must advocate for independent, transparent, and people-centered investigations into these human rights issues. We must, however, proceed cautiously because, given the current political climate and the legal validation of red-tagging in the form of the Anti-Terror Act of 2022, public dissent is likely to be perceived as a threat. As individuals, the least we can do is to initiate online and offline campaigns, create and join support groups for the victims, and exercise caution when interacting with the reported offenders.</p>

								<h3  style="color:#E50914">What can we do more?</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Although ACLED labels the actors involved in a case with sufficient clarity, some data points lack information on the demographics of the victims. Manual labeling of such is recommended to reach more accurate and comprehensive conclusions.</li>
									<li>Columns that were dropped, such as the notes column that provides additional context about the event, can undergo Natural Language Processing in order to more features to and further improve the overall accuracy of the logistic regression model.
									</li>
								</ol>
